# Backend Learning Journey with Dart Frog

Welcome to my backend learning journey repository! This repository contains my personal notes, code, and resources while learning backend development using Dart Frog and Flutter. The aim is to master backend fundamentals and progressively build real-world applications using Dart Frog.

In this repo, you will find everything I learn about backend development, including HTTP, REST API principles, database management, authentication, and more. The following roadmap will guide you through the topics in the order that I plan to learn them.

## 1. Understanding Backend Fundamentals

To get started in backend development, you need to understand the following basic concepts:

### HTTP and REST API
- What is the HTTP protocol?
- Learn about request types like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Understand the principles of REST APIs.

### JSON and Data Formats
- Understand the JSON format and how backend communicates with frontend using it.

### Client-Server Model
- Understand how the backend communicates with the frontend.

---

## 2. Getting Started with Dart Frog

Dart Frog is an excellent backend framework for Dart developers. Follow these steps:

### Dart Frog Installation
- Install Dart Frog and create a simple "Hello, World!" endpoint.

[**Dart Frog Installation Guide**](https://dartfrog.io/docs/installation)

### Building a Basic REST API
- Create a `/hello` endpoint that returns a static JSON response.
- Learn how to create dynamic endpoints like `/user/:id`.

### Using Middleware
- Add middleware like logging or authentication.

ðŸ“š **Step:**
- As you develop the project, create a repository: `backend-learning-with-dart-frog`.
- Update the README.md file with details of what you have accomplished.

---

## 3. Learning Database Management

A backend developer cannot go without learning databases. Start with these steps:

### SQL vs NoSQL
- Learn the differences between SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase).

### Starting with PostgreSQL
- Install PostgreSQL and learn basic SQL queries.
- Connect PostgreSQL with Dart Frog.
- Create a user table and implement CRUD operations.

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Learn Dart ORM libraries like `postgres` or `drift`.

ðŸ“š **Step:**
- Write down what you learned about SQL in Markdown files (e.g., `02-database-basics.md`).
- Place your database integration code inside a `database` folder in the GitHub repository.

---

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

User authentication is a crucial part of backend development. Follow these steps:

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Understand what JWT is and how it works.
- Implement JWT for user login.

### Middleware for Security
- Write middleware for authentication in Dart Frog.

### OAuth and Social Login
- Integrate OAuth providers like Google and Facebook for authentication.

ðŸ“š **Step:**
- Add your authentication processes in a folder called `auth` and write a detailed README.

---

## 5. Advanced Topics

To take your backend skills to the next level, focus on the following topics:

### Real-Time Communication
- Learn real-time communication using WebSocket or gRPC.

### Caching and Performance
- Use Redis for data caching.

### Deployment
- Containerize your backend app with Docker.
- Deploy your app on cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

ðŸ“š **Step:**
- Document each of these advanced topics in separate folders and add them to your GitHub repository.

---

## 6. Building a Practical Project

Now it's time to apply everything you've learned by building a project.

### Project Idea: Blog API
- Users can register, log in, create posts, and list posts via API.

### Backend Structure:
- `/auth` â†’ User registration and login.
- `/posts` â†’ CRUD operations for blog posts.
- `/comments` â†’ Add comments to blog posts.

ðŸ“š **Step:**
- Share the project on GitHub and explain the project structure in the README.md file.

---

## 7. Learning and Documentation Strategy

Document everything you learn along the way:

### Document Each Topic
- Write your notes in Markdown files for each topic (e.g., `03-authentication-basics.md`).

### Explain Code Samples
- Include code examples and explain why you wrote the code that way in the README file.

### GitHub Usage
- Create a new branch for each topic and track your progress using commit messages.
- Example commit message: `Add basic authentication middleware`.
