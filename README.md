# Backend Learning Journey with Dart Frog

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning backend development using **Dart Frog**. Throughout this repository, I will document my learnings, share code examples, and create tutorials to explain various backend concepts. By the end of this journey, I aim to have a clear understanding of backend development and be able to build professional backend applications using Dart Frog.

## 1. Understanding Backend Basics

- **HTTP & REST APIs:**
  - What is HTTP?
  - Learn about request types like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - Principles of REST API architecture.
  
- **JSON and Data Formats:**
  - Understanding JSON and how data is exchanged in backend services.
  
- **Client-Server Model:**
  - How backend communicates with frontend and how requests are handled.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Understand the core principles of backend development, focusing on how backend services communicate with the frontend and how data is exchanged.

## 2. Getting Started with Dart Frog

- **Dart Frog Setup:**
  - Install Dart Frog and create a simple "Hello, World!" endpoint.
  
- **Basic REST API Development:**
  - Create a simple `/hello` endpoint returning static JSON data.
  - Learn how to build dynamic endpoints like `/user/:id`.

- **Middleware Usage:**
  - Add and use middleware for functionalities like logging and authentication.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Learn how to set up Dart Frog, create basic REST API endpoints, and implement middleware for enhancing functionality.

## 3. Database Management

- **SQL vs NoSQL:**
  - Understand the differences between SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase) databases.
  
- **Starting with PostgreSQL:**
  - Install PostgreSQL and write basic SQL queries.
  - Set up a PostgreSQL connection in Dart Frog and perform CRUD operations.

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**
  - Learn Dart ORM libraries like `postgres` or `drift`.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Understand the basics of SQL and NoSQL databases, learn how to connect PostgreSQL with Dart Frog, and implement CRUD operations using an ORM.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**
  - Learn what JWT is and how it works for user authentication.
  
- **Middleware for Authentication:**
  - Write middleware for user authentication and protect API routes.

- **OAuth and Social Login:**
  - Integrate OAuth providers like Google and Facebook for login.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Master authentication and authorization in Dart Frog, including using JWTs and integrating OAuth providers for user login.

## 5. Advanced Topics

- **Real-Time Communication:**
  - Learn how to implement WebSocket or gRPC for real-time communication.
  
- **Caching and Performance:**
  - Implement Redis caching to enhance performance.
  
- **Deployment:**
  - Dockerize your backend application and deploy it on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Take your backend skills to the next level with real-time communication, caching, performance optimizations, and deployment strategies.

## 6. Building Practical Projects

Now that you've learned the basics and advanced topics, it's time to put everything into practice. A great project to work on is a **Blog API**.

### Blog API Features:
- **/auth** â†’ User registration and login.
- **/posts** â†’ CRUD operations for blog posts.
- **/comments** â†’ Adding comments to blog posts.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Build a real-world application that integrates everything you've learned so far, from authentication to handling CRUD operations.

## 7. Learning and Documentation Strategy

- **Document Every Topic:**
  - Write everything you learn in Markdown files (e.g., `01-backend-basics.md`).
  
- **Explain Code Examples:**
  - For every code snippet you add, provide an explanation in the README to ensure clarity.
  
- **GitHub Workflow:**
  - Create a new branch for each topic and commit your progress. Example commit: `Add basic authentication middleware`.

ðŸ“š **What You'll Learn:**  
Document and organize your learnings in a clear and structured way. This helps reinforce your understanding and creates a valuable resource for others.

## Final Thoughts

This repository is a reflection of my learning process in backend development using Dart Frog. As I progress, I will continue to update this repository with new topics, code examples, and tutorials. I hope that it will serve as both a personal learning resource and a guide for anyone else who is looking to learn backend development with Dart Frog.
